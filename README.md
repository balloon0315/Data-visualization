# Data Visualization Portfolio

This repository is used as my data visualization portfolio.<br/>
From entry to be HIGHER level .<br/>
**KEEP LEARNING!!!**<br/>

## Overview
**Programming Language**\
[Python](#python)

**Software**\
[Tableau](#tableau)\
[Graphvia](#graphviz)


### Python
Since some plots are interactive they can be best viewed using the link below:

**Introduction to data visualization using Plotly and Matplotlib :** 
[Link Page](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/balloon0315/Data-visualization-Portfolio/blob/master/Introduction%20to%20data%20visualization%20using%20Plotly%20and%20Matplotlib.ipynb)<br/>
- Various basic plots can be used in visualization. Several different graphs can be combined by using subplot, which can provide a comprehensive visual report for the user.

**Choropleth & Scattergeo Map visualization using Plotly :** 
[Link Page](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/balloon0315/Data-visualization-Portfolio/blob/master/Choropleth%26Scattergeo%20Map%20visualization%20using%20Plotly..ipynb)<br/>
- A Choropleth map shows the boundaries of countries, US states, and counties. We can choose to show specific states or counties and color code the shape of states or counties.
- A Scattergeo object is a marker placed on a map. We can create a Scattergeo object and customize it by mapping different data variables to visual variables and adjusting layout parameters. 

**Map visualization using Folium; Network using NetworkX :** 
[Link Page](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/balloon0315/Data-visualization-Portfolio/blob/master/Map%20visualization%20using%20Folium%3B%20Network%20using%20NetworkX.ipynb)<br/>
- Folium is used to create interactive maps. Folium is based on Leaflet.js, which is based on OpenStreetMap. 
- NetworkX can be used to build and analyze networks. NetworkX also includes many layout algorithm.

**social media sentimental analysis using Plotly :** 
[Link Page](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/balloon0315/Data-visualization-Portfolio/blob/master/social%20media%20sentimental%20analysis%20using%20Plotly%20.ipynb)<br/>
- Using social media API to get the information we need. text visualization and network visualization can be used in this.


### Tableau

**New York Airbnb using Tableau :** <br/>
The data used for building a sample dashboard is New York Airbnb. And it's available in sample datasets in Tableau.
